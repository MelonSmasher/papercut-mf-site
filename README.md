## First Run

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MelonSmasher/papercut-mf-site.git && cd papercut-mf-site
```

First, create a `.env` with the `init.sh` script.

Stop the container stack.

```bash
docker compose down
```

Edit the `.env` file, change the `PAPERCUT_MF_VERSION` to the version you want to upgrade to.

Bring the container stack back up.

```bash
docker compose up -d

## SMB

The container runs an SMB server that publishes a read only share that lets you access the Papercut client. This can be accessed at `\\hostname-or-ip\pc-client`.

## Migration from other server to container

Stop the Papercut MF application server on the old server.

Create the volumes directories on the new server.

```bash
mkdir -p vols/app/{conf,custom,data,reports,logs}
```

Initialize the `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files with the `init.sh` script. The version should be exactly the same as the old server.

```bash
./init.sh <version> # e.g. ./init.sh 20.0.4.55447
```

Copy the `application.license` file from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/conf/` directory. The container will automatically import the license file on startup.

Copy the `server.uuid` file from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/conf/` directory. The container will automatically import the server uuid file on startup.

Copy the contents of the `custom/` directory from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/custom/` directory.

Copy the contents of the `data/` directory from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/data/` directory.

Copy the contents of the `reports/` directory from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/reports/` directory.

Copy the contents of the `logs/` directory from the old server to the new server and place it in the `vols/app/logs/` directory.

Take a backup of the database through the papercut web interface. Then mount the backup zip file to `/papercut/import.zip` in the docker-compose.yml file as a volume. There is an example in the `docker-compose.yml` file that is commented out.

After the docker-compose file is modified, run the following command to start the container stack.

```bash
docker compose up
```

You should notice records being imported by watching output of the container.

After the import is complete, you can stop the container stack.

Remove the volume mount for the import.zip file from the docker-compose.yml file.

Then run the following command to start the container stack again.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## MySQL and OracleDB

To use MySQL you'll have to [manually download the MySQL JDBC driver](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/ext-db-specific-my-sql/) and mount it to `/papercut/server/lib-ext/mysql-connector-java-x.y.z.jar`. You'll have to manually maintain the MySQL JDBC driver and ensure that you have the correct version for your MySQL server.

To use OracleDB you'll have to [manually download the Oracle JDBC driver](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/ext-db-specific-oracle/) and mount it to `/papercut/server/lib-ext/ojdbcx.jar`. You'll have to manually maintain the Oracle JDBC driver and ensure that you have the correct version for your OracleDB server.

For this reason PostgreSQL is set as the default database.
